# WORKCD

This project aims to improve contracting experience for time-based workers. As an employee I can go to the web page, select a company that I'm hired for and start working while the pay is sent to my wallet in real-time. No more iffy end-of-the-month discussions with clients on whether they're going to pay or not. If the work is done the salary is paid. As an employer I can easily set up a company, hire employees and create an inflow that will be directed to my employees when they're working.


PS: Currently it only supports streaming DAIx on the Ropsten network

## HOW-TO

Understanding money streams via Superfluid is an essential part of this project. I suggest reading up on https://www.superfluid.finance before starting.

### For employers

Prerequisite for this is that you have Superfluid's "Super Tokens" on your wallet which you can stream. Currently the project only supports streaming DAIx on the Ropsten network.

* Connect your wallet
* Create a new company
* Hire your first employee
  * Salary field is the natural units of the Super Token with 18 decimal places
* Start flowing money into your company contract
  * Inflow should be at least as big as the outflow sum for all the workers


### For employees

* Connect your wallet
* Select a company you're hired for
* Start working and see the funds flowing to your account at https://app.superfluid.finance/
